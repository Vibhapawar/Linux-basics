File Permission:
 The permissions of a file are the first line of 
 defense in the security of a Unix system.The basic 
 building blocks of Unix permissions are the read,
 write, and execute permissions, which have been
 described below −The permissions of a file are the
 first line of defense in the security of a Unix 
 system. The basic building blocks of Unix permissions 
 are the read, write, and execute permissions, which
 have been described below −

 *Read
  Grants the capability to read, i.e., view the
  contents of the file.

 *Write
  Grants the capability to modify, or remove the
  content of the file.

 *Execute
  User with execute permissions can run a file as 
  a program.

*Directory Permission:
  Directory access modes are listed and organized in
  the same manner as any other file.
  There are a few differences that need to be 
  mentioned −

  *Read
   Access to a directory means that the user can read
   the contents. The user can look at the filenames 
   inside the directory.

  *Write
   Access means that the user can add or delete files 
   from the directory.

  *Execute
    Executing a directory doesn't really make sense,
    so think of this as a traverse permission.

   A user must have execute access to the bin 
   directory in order to execute the ls or the cd 
   command.
