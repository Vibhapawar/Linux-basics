Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a device mapper 
framework that provides logical volume management 
for the Linux kernel.
Most modern Linux distributions are LVM-aware to the 
point of being able to have their root file systems
on a logical volume.

The commands are:
  1. create a pv- pvcreate [devices]
  2.show a pv   - pvdisplay
  3.create a vg - vgcreate vgname [pv]
  4.show a vg   - vgdisplay
  5.create a lv - lvcreate -n name -L [size] name
  6.show a lv   - lvdisplay
