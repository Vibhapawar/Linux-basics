Soft link:
A soft link (also known as Symbolic link).
It acts as a pointer or a reference to the file name. 
It does not access the data available in the original 
file. 
Each soft linked file contains a separate Inode value
that points to the original file. 
Soft links can be linked across different file systems,
although if the original file is deleted or moved, the
soft linked file will not work correctly (called 
hanging link).
ls -l command shows all links with first column value 
l? and the link points to original file.
Soft Link contains the path for original file and not
the contents.
Removing soft link doesn’t affect anything but 
removing original file, the link becomes “dangling”
link which points to nonexistent file.
A soft link can link to a directory.
Hard links:
A hard link acts as a copy (mirrored) of the selected
file. 
It accesses the data available in the original file.
If the earlier selected file is deleted, the hard link 
to the file will still contain the data of that file.
Links have actual file contents.
Removing any link, just reduces the link count, but 
doesn’t affect other links.
Even if we change the filename of the original file
then also the hard links properly work.
We cannot create a hard link for a directory to avoid
recursive loops.
If original file is removed then the link will still
show the content of the file.
The size of any of the hard link file is same as the 
original file and if we change the content in any of
the hard links then size of all hard link files are 
updated.
